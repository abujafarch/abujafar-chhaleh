## :bust_in_silhouette: About Me 
Being passionate about problem-solving, I am constantly acquiring knowledge in computer programming. I'm exploring web development and have already established myself as a React front-end developer(HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript, React, React Router). In addition, I can work with some backend technologies. Eg: Nodejs, ExpressJS, MongoDB. So, I am moving towards becoming a full-stack developer.
